## Module Setup

:ModuleInstall{name="@nuxtjs/sitemap"}

## Previewing Your Sitemap

After you've set up the module with the minimal config, you should be able to visit [`/sitemap.xml`](http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml) to see the generated sitemap.

All pages preset are discovered from your [Application Sources](/sitemap/getting-started/data-sources), for dynamic URLs see [Dynamic URLs](/sitemap/guides/dynamic-urls).

You can debug this further in Nuxt DevTools under the Sitemap tab.

## Next Steps

It's recommended to use this module with Nuxt Robots so that the sitemap paths are automatically added to your robots.txt file.

:ModuleCard{slug="robots" class="w-1/2"}

Other suggestions:

- You may want to add your own sources, see [Dynamic URLs](/sitemap/guides/dynamic-urls).
- Have 1000's of pages? Consider using [Multiple Sitemaps](/sitemap/guides/multi-sitemaps).
- Ready to go Live? See [Submitting Your Sitemap](/sitemap/guides/submitting-sitemap).
