## Debugging

### Nuxt DevTools

The best tool for debugging is the Nuxt DevTools integration with Nuxt Sitemap.

This will show you all of your sitemaps and the sources used to generate it.

### Debug Endpoint

If you prefer looking at the raw data, you can use the debug endpoint. This is only enabled in
development unless you enable the `debug` option.

Visit `/__sitemap__/debug.json` within your browser, this is the same data used by Nuxt DevTools.

### Debugging Prerendering

If you're trying to debug the prerendered sitemap, you should enable the `debug` option and check your output
for the file `.output/public/__sitemap__/debug.json`.

## Submitting an Issue

When submitting an issue, it's important to provide as much information as possible.

The easiest way to do this is to create a minimal reproduction using the Stackblitz playgrounds:

- [Dynamic URLs](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-dyraxc?file=server%2Fapi%2F_sitemap-urls.ts)
- [i18n](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-jwuie4?file=app.vue)
- [Manual Chunking](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-umyso3?file=nuxt.config.ts)
- [Nuxt Content Document Driven](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-a5qk3s?file=nuxt.config.ts)

## Troubleshooting FAQ

### Why is my browser not rendering the XML properly?

When disabling the [XSL](/docs/sitemap/guides/customising-ui#disabling-the-xls) (XML Stylesheet) in, the XML will
be rendered by the browser.

If you have a i18n integration, then it's likely you'll see your sitemap look raw text instead of XML.

![Broken XML because of xhtml namespace.](/docs/sitemap/formatting-error.png)

This is a [browser bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=580033) in parsing the `xhtml` namespace which is required to add localised URLs to your sitemap.
There is no workaround besides re-enabled the XSL.

### Google Search Console shows Error when submitting my Sitemap?

Seeing "Error" when submitting a new sitemap is common. This is because Google previously
crawled your site for a sitemap and found nothing.

If your sitemap is [validating](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html) correctly, then you're all set.
It's best to way a few days and check back. In nearly all cases, the error will resolve itself.
