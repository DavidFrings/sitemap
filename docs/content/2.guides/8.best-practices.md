## Set appropriate lastmod

The `lastmod` field is used to indicate when a page was last updated. This is used by search engines to determine how often to crawl your site.

This should not change based on code changes, only for updating the content.

For example, if you have a blog post, the `lastmod` should be updated when the content of the blog post changes.

It's recommended not to use `autoLastmod: true` as this will use the last time the page was built, which does
not always reflect content updates.

## You probably don't need `changefreq` or `priority`

These two fields are not used by search engines, and are only used by crawlers to determine how often to crawl your site.

If you're trying to get your site crawled more often, you should use the `lastmod` field instead.
