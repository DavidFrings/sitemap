title: Setting Lastmod
description: Learn how to set the lastmod of your sitemap URLs.

In some cases you'll want to set the `lastmod`, `changefreq`, or `priority` of your sitemap URLs. To
do this, you have a few options depending on your setup.

See [Best Practices](/sitemap/guides/best-practices) for details on how to optimize these values.

## Page Meta

Support for configuring these values through `definePageMeta` is coming soon.

## Prerendering Lastmod

When prerendering your site, you can make use of setting the `article:modified_time` meta tag in your page's head. This
meta tag will be used as the `lastmod` value in your sitemap.

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup>
useSeoMeta({
  // will be inferred as the lastmod value in the sitemap
  articleModifiedTime: '2023-01-01'
})
</script>
```

## Route Rules

A more general approach is to use [Route rules](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config/#routerules).

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/about': { sitemap: { changefreq: 'daily', priority: 0.3 } }
  }
})
```

Alternatively, you can use the [defineRouteRules](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-route-rules) helper on specific pages.

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script setup>
defineRouteRules({
  sitemap: {
    changefreq: 'daily',
    priority: 0.3
  }
})
</script>
```

Using `defineRouteRules` feature is experimental and in order to use it you must enable the `experimental.inlineRouteRules` option in your nuxt.config.
