description: How to debug the sitemap generated from Nuxt Sitemap.

It's quite likely at some point you'll open your sitemap and think "this isn't right".

## Nuxt DevTools

The best tool for debugging is the Nuxt DevTools integration with Nuxt Sitemap.

This will show you all of your sitemaps and the sources used to generate it.

## Debug Endpoint

If you prefer looking at the raw data, you can use the debug endpoint. This is only enabled in
development unless you enable the `debug` option.

Visit `/__sitemap__/debug.json` within your browser, this is the same data used by Nuxt DevTools.

## Debugging Prerendering

If you're trying to debug the prerendered sitemap, you should enable the `debug` option and check your output
for the file `.output/public/__sitemap__/debug.json`.
