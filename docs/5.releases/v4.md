description: Release notes for v4.0.0 of Nuxt Sitemap.
---

## Background

Over the last couple of months I've had many issues reported with similar themes:
- Dynamic URLs are hard to work with
- It's difficult to get multiple sitemaps to show the correct URLs
- I18n has many small issues

I hope this release can resolve these. It has required replacing much of the underlying logic, please test your sitemaps after upgrading.

## Features :rocket:

### ü•´ Sitemap Sources

The v4 introduces the official concept of 'sources' to your sitemaps.

Every URL within your sitemap will belong to a source. A source will either be a User source or a Application source.

This concept existed before v4 in different forms, v4 aims to clean them up and make working with them much easier.

For full documentation see [Sitemap Sources](/sitemap/getting-started/data-sources).

### ü§ù Nuxt Dev Tools Integration

Nuxt Sitemap now has a dedicated tab in Nuxt Dev Tools to help you debug.

### üí¨ More i18n Improvements

- Locale domain support ([#155](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/sitemap/issues/155))
- Support pages opt-outed using `defineI18nRoute(false)` ([#126](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/sitemap/issues/126))
- Only add trusted i18n routes, will use meta tags when prerendering
- Less aggressive filtering
- Opt-in to transform dynamic URLs `__i18nTransform: true`

See the updated [i18n documentation](/sitemap/integrations/i18n)

### üöÄ Caching Improvements

Now utilises native route rules. By default will set up SWR rules for 10 minutes.

Learn more on the [Sitemap Caching](/sitemap/guides/cache) guide.

## Other Improvements

### Nitro Composables for better types

When creating an API endpoint that returns URLs you should use the new `defineSitemapEventHandler` function for full TypeScript support.

```ts
// api/sitemap.ts
export default defineSitemapEventHandler(() => {
  return ['/foo']
})
```

### Prerendering Improvements

Previously prerendering was done in a Node context, this will now run in a Nitro context which will provide better consistency between prerender and runtime environments.

### Video Support

Video entries are now supported properly. ([#159](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/sitemap/issues/159))

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecations

- `cacheTtl` is deprecated, you should use `cacheMaxAgeSeconds` which is more explicit.
- `inferStaticPagesAsRoutes` is deprecated, if you were using this to opt-out of pages, you should use `excludeAppSources: true`

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

### Nuxt Hooks no longer supported

If you were using Nuxt hooks to modify the prerendered sitemap, you will need to migrate these to Nitro hooks.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  hooks: {
    // old - no longer supported
    'sitemap:resolved': function (ctx) {},
    'sitemap:output': function (ctx) {}
  },
})
```

```ts [server/plugins/sitemap]
export default defineNitroPlugin((nitroApp) => {
  nitroApp.hooks.hook('sitemap:output', async (ctx) => {
    // supported!
  })
})
```

### Multi Sitemap App Sources

By default, app sources will no longer be included in multi sitemap implementations. You will need to use `includeAppSources: true` to re-enable it. See [Extending App Sources](/sitemap/guides/multi-sitemaps#extending-app-sources) for more information.

### Removed deprecations

- The hook `sitemap:prerender` has been removed. You should use `sitemap:resolved` instead.
- The config `trailingSlash` and `siteUrl` has been removed. You should use site config, see [Setting Site Config](/site-config/guides/setting-site-config).
- The config `autoAlternativeLangPrefixes` has been removed. If you'd like to set up automatic alternative language prefixes use `__i18nTransform`.
